### Image Resize GUI
***
##### Challenge:
While taking a course on Python through The Tech Academy of Portland, I was prompted to design and develop a project of my choosing using Visual Studio's Python Tools. I decided to create a GUI that would allow users to easily resize images on their machine.

##### Action Taken:
I first drafted a model of the GUI's design and function, and after gaining approval from my instructor, began coding using Visual Studio's Python 3.4 tools. The GUI is built using Tkinter's themed widgets and the acual image resizing is done through PIL. 

##### Result:
I am extremely pleased with my resulting GUI and its functionality! It has scalebars to resize both the height and width of a chosen image, and as a user drags the scalebar cursors, the image is resized in real-time within the GUI's display. The one downside of my program is image size restraint--I had to limit the maximum pixel proportions of the chosen image so that everything would properly display in the GUI without running off the screen. One functionality I might add in the future is the option to keep the original image pixel ratio constant as the image is resized, so that users can resize images without stretching them too much vertically or horizontally.
