# library_project
a library simulation drill completed during a course on databases and sql

While taking a course offered by The Tech Academy covering Databases and SQL, I was challenged to create a database that would 
simulate a library system and then make queries to retreive specific data. Using SQL Server 2008 R2, I wrote a script to create and populate tables with data to represent the library's branches, books, customers, and outstanding book loans. I then tackled a set of problems posed to return specific information by running queries on the database.
