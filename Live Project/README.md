### Live Project
***
##### Challenge:
Upon completing my final instructional course at the Tech Academy, I was invited to work with another student, Dallin, on a Live Project to re-design the Tech Academy's website: http://learncodinganywhere.com. Under the guidance of our Live Project In-Charge, Cliff, we worked two 1-week sprints to make various modifications and additions to the site. 

##### Action Taken:
Using a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/sdorway11/newWebsite) to house our working version of the website and Gmail/Slack for communication, Cliff assigned Dallin and I tasks to complete from a Google Sheets document and held daily stand-ups over the phone. I utilized Aptana Studio 3 to tackle my list of tasks, including: 
* designing a webpage for prospective employers to learn more about The Tech Academy and how to hire bootcamp graduates
* creating a custom user-friendly 404 page for the website
* drafting Google [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/about-amp.html) versions of several webpages to optimize mobile browsing
* applying various JavaScript effects to elements on the site
* adding custom navigation arrows to a slick.js slideshow
* cleaning up old HTML and CSS code on the site and pushing all in-line CSS to an external stylesheet

##### Result:
This project was a great experience! It was my first collaborative coding experience and I learned a lot about version control in a team setting and web design in general over the two weeks. The most challenging aspect of our project for me was creating Google AMP versions of our existing webpages. There are a variety of strict limitations for AMP HTML pages, such as an outright ban on any JavaScript, requiring all CSS to be defined in the header of the HTML (no in-line, no external stylesheets), limiting all CSS code to 50KB per page, and disallowing the use of many HTML tags, CSS properties and qualifiers, and custom fonts. Needless to say this necessitated a complete re-drafting of the webpages, but will hopefully allow for smoother and faster mobile browsing on the site. Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project with Dallin and Cliff, and I hope the website's re-design will get the Tech Academy more traffic from both prospective students and employers.
