### Live Project
***
##### Challenge:
Upon completing my final instructional course at the Tech Academy, I was invited to work with another student, Dallin, on a Live Project to re-design the Tech Academy's website: http://learncodinganywhere.com. Under the guidance of our Live Project In-Charge, Cliff, we worked in two 1-week sprints to make various modifications and additions to the site. 

##### Action Taken:
Using a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/sdorway11/newWebsite) to house our working version of the website and Gmail/Slack for communication, Cliff assigned Dallin and I tasks to complete from a Google Sheets document and held daily stand-ups over the phone. I utilized Aptana Studio 3 to tackle my list of tasks, including: 
* designing a webpage for prospective employers to learn more about The Tech Academy and how to hire bootcamp graduates
* creating a custom user-friendly 404 page for the website
* drafting Google [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/about-amp.html) versions of several webpages to optimize mobile browsing
* applying various JavaScript effects to elements on the site
* adding custom navigation arrows to a slick.js slideshow
* cleaning up old HTML and CSS code on the site and pushing all in-line CSS to an external stylesheet

##### Result:
